= ClamAV scanning Docker image

This image provides a very simple way to run `clamscan` on your machine.

It will always update the ClamAV Database, by using the standard `freshclam` before running `clamscan`.

== How to use

[source,shell]
docker run -ti \
           -v clamav-db:/var/lib/clamav \
           -v ~/dev/github/batmat/devbox:/toscan:ro \
           batmat/clamscan -i

NOTE: the `-v clamav-db:/var/lib/clamav` line above is mostly a nice to have, but will save you some time (~2 minutes on my not-so-fast Internet access) to not download the update antivirus DB from scratch each time.
